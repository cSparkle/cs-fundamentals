1. The most notable advantage of using a linked list is its ability to reduce the memory load
making it less "expensive" in terms of storage. Whereas an array is ordered requiring the location of an element in memory
to be directly adjacent to the next element in the array, linked lists can allocate memory for an element at any location.
Therefore, with linked lists, the process of adding, modifying, or deleting an element/node does not impact the location of any other node, 
but only updates the reference so all nodes are connected. With an array, all items in array need to be shifted in memory location when
an element is added to the beginning or middle of the array.

Linked lists do have a major disadvantage, though, in that elements can only be accessed in a sequential manner. With an array, 
direct access is possible meaning the element at index 0 is just as easily retrieved as the element at index 1000. In a linked list,
accessing the 1001th element would require traversing through all 1000 previous elements. This can be an inefficient means of access,
especially with larger linked lists.


2. The nearest example I can think that compares to a linked list is a person who is tracking down someone or something. This is seen often in
TV and movies when a character is retracing their own steps in order to find something. They must start at the beginning then
follow the "link" of references that point to a new place or person in order to get more clues as to the location of the person/thing they desire.


Programming Answers:

1. 
Bug: the else statement should include a while loop that checks to see when current.next is equal to null (i.e. checking where the end of the list is).
This tells this.push to keep searching for the end of the list. Once this is reached, then <SET current.next to node> should be run to add the element passed to 
the function that is set to this.push. 

Within a LinkedList class, the push function would look like so:

const Node = function(element) {
    this.element = element;
    this.next = null;
}

this.push = function(element) {
    const node = new Node(element);
    if (head === null) {
        head = node;
    } else {
        let currentNode = head;
        while (currentNode.next) {
            currentNode = currentNode.next;
        }

        currentNode.next = node;
    }
};
